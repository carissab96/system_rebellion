# System Rebellion Resilience Strategies

## Introduction: From Phosphor Green to Quantum Optimization

The System Rebellion application now includes a comprehensive set of resilience strategies to make the system more robust, reliable, and self-healing. These strategies are designed to prevent cascading failures, manage system load, and provide automatic recovery from common errors.

## Core Components

### 1. WebSocket Circuit Breaker

The circuit breaker pattern prevents cascading failures when WebSocket connections fail repeatedly. It implements:

- Automatic failure detection and circuit opening
- Exponential backoff for retry attempts
- Half-open state for testing recovery
- Automatic circuit closing when the system recovers

```python
# Example usage
metrics_circuit_breaker = get_circuit_breaker(
    name="metrics_websocket", 
    max_failures=3,
    reset_timeout=30,
    exponential_backoff_factor=1.5
)

# Protected function execution
result = await metrics_circuit_breaker.execute(my_function, *args, **kwargs)
```

### 2. Backpressure Handling

The backpressure handler manages data flow to prevent overwhelming the system when data is produced faster than it can be consumed. Features include:

- Configurable buffer size and sampling strategies
- Adaptive sampling based on system pressure
- Intelligent item prioritization
- Performance monitoring and statistics

```python
# Example usage
metrics_backpressure = get_backpressure_handler(
    name="metrics_backpressure",
    max_buffer_size=100,
    sampling_strategy="latest"
)

# Add items to the buffer
metrics_backpressure.add_item(item)

# Get a batch of items for processing
batch = metrics_backpressure.get_batch(max_batch_size=10)
```

### 3. Autonomous Error Recovery

The error recovery system provides automatic recovery strategies for different types of errors. It includes:

- Multiple recovery strategies (retry, fallback, circuit break, reset, notify)
- Configurable retry policies with exponential backoff
- Error history tracking and statistics
- Decorator for easy integration with existing code

```python
# Example usage with decorator
@with_error_recovery(component="websocket", operation="connect", severity=ErrorSeverity.HIGH)
async def connect_websocket(url):
    # Function implementation...

# Manual error handling
try:
    result = await my_function()
except Exception as e:
    result = await error_recovery.handle_error(
        error=e,
        component="my_component",
        operation="my_operation",
        severity=ErrorSeverity.MEDIUM,
        original_function=my_function,
        *args, **kwargs
    )
```

### 4. Metric Transformation

The metric transformer provides real-time processing of system metrics using NumPy for high-performance data analysis. Features include:

- Statistical analysis (mean, std dev, percentiles)
- Anomaly detection using Z-scores
- Data smoothing with moving averages
- Trend analysis and prediction
- System health assessment

```python
# Example usage
metric_transformer = get_metric_transformer(
    name="system_metrics",
    history_size=120,  # 2 minutes of history at 1s intervals
    smoothing_window=5
)

# Transform metrics
transformed_metrics = metric_transformer.transform_system_metrics(raw_metrics)
```

## Integration with WebSocket Implementation

The resilience strategies have been integrated into the WebSocket implementation to provide:

1. Protection against connection failures with circuit breaker
2. Smooth data flow with backpressure handling
3. Automatic recovery from common errors
4. Enhanced metrics with statistical analysis and anomaly detection

## Benefits

- Prevents cascading failures when connections fail
- Manages system load during high traffic
- Provides automatic recovery from common errors
- Enhances metrics with statistical analysis
- Improves overall system stability and reliability

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with machine learning for predictive failure detection
- Enhanced anomaly detection with more sophisticated algorithms
- Distributed circuit breaker for multi-node deployments
- Real-time visualization of system resilience metrics
