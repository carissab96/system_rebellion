# üî• SYSTEM REBELLION üî•

Welcome to the revolution, comrade! System Rebellion isn't just another boring optimization tool - it's a full-scale uprising against the tyranny of inefficient system resources. We're here to liberate your CPU cycles, emancipate your memory, and lead your hardware to FREEDOM!

## üöÄ What the Hell is This?

System Rebellion is the badass lovechild of system monitoring and performance tuning. We don't just *suggest* changes to your system - we MAKE them happen with real sudo powers and zero f*cks given. Your hardware has been oppressed for too long by inefficient settings and suboptimal configurations. It's time to RISE UP!

## üß® Latest Acts of Rebellion (Changelog)

### May 2025: The "Terminal Liberation" Update

- **REAL SYSTEM TUNING**: We're not playing pretend anymore! Your CPU governor, network buffers, disk read-ahead, and more will be ACTUALLY CHANGED. The simulation is over, comrades!

- **CENTRALIZED METRICS SERVICE**: One source of truth for all system metrics. No more inconsistent readings across different parts of the app. THE TRUTH SHALL SET YOU FREE!

- **SYSTEM LOGS VIEWER**: Terminal output is now visible directly in the UI! No more switching to a terminal to see what the hell is happening. Authentication attempts, system tuning actions, command outputs - ALL VISIBLE TO THE MASSES!

- **PERSISTENT TUNING HISTORY**: Your optimization history now survives logout/login and server restarts. The rebellion's memory is ETERNAL!

## üí£ Features That Stick It to The Man

- **Real-time System Metrics**: CPU, memory, disk, and network usage displayed in glorious real-time

- **Auto-Tuner**: Let our AI overlord suggest and apply system optimizations that actually work

- **Optimization Profiles**: Save your favorite system configurations and apply them with one click

- **Pattern Analysis**: We analyze your system usage patterns to predict future resource needs

- **System Logs**: See all system events in one place, no terminal required

## üîß How to Join the Rebellion

1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/system-rebellion/system-rebellion.git`
2. Install dependencies: 
   ```
   cd system_rebellion
   pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
   cd frontend && npm install
   ```
3. Set up the database: `cd ../backend && python -m alembic upgrade head`
4. Run the backend: `python -m uvicorn main:app --reload`
5. Run the frontend: `cd ../frontend && npm run dev`
6. FIGHT THE POWER at http://localhost:5173

## üîê Required Permissions

To fully unleash the rebellion, you'll need to run our permission setup script:

```bash
cd backend && python setup_permissions.py
```

This will grant the necessary sudo powers to make REAL system changes. Don't worry, we'll only modify what you approve.

## üß† Tech Stack of the Resistance

- **Backend**: FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + Pydantic (Python 3.10+)
- **Frontend**: React + Redux + TypeScript + Vite
- **UI**: Material UI (for that sleek revolutionary aesthetic)
- **System Access**: Real sudo commands, sysctl, and kernel parameter modifications

## üîç Architecture

### Backend Services

- **SystemMetricsService**: Centralized singleton service for consistent metrics
- **SystemLogService**: Captures and stores all system events
- **AutoTuner**: Analyzes and applies real system optimizations

### Frontend Components

- **Auto-Tuner Dashboard**: Real-time metrics and recommendations
- **System Logs Viewer**: Terminal-style log display with filtering
- **Optimization Profiles**: Save and apply your favorite configurations

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

Feel free to tweak the rebellion to your needs. Edit `backend/app/core/config.py` to adjust settings like:

- Metrics collection interval
- Auto-tuning aggressiveness
- Log retention period
